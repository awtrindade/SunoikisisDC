The goal is to extend Sunoikisis to a global audience and contribute to it with an international consortium of Digital Classics programs (SunoikisisDC). SunoikisisDC is based at the [Alexander von Humboldt Chair of Digital Humanities](http://www.dh.uni-leipzig.de/wo/) at the University of Leipzig. The aim is to offer collaborative courses that foster interdisciplinary paradigms of learning. Master students of both the humanities and computer science are welcome to join the courses and work together by contributing to digital classics projects in a collaborative environment.\r\n\r\nSunoikisisDC will start in the SS 2015 with a Digital Classics course at the University of Leipzig. Faculty members of participating institutions gathered at the University of Leipzig on February 16-18 for a [planning seminar](http://www.dh.uni-leipzig.de/wo/wokshops-seminars/sunoikisis-dc-2015/) in order to discuss course topics, schedule the academic calendar, and construct the course syllabus.
